# My Analysis
The obvious solution is indeed that and pretty quick to come to, but scores only 75% (100, 33), because
it has to permutate through all the combinations: O(N**3)
The smart solution you might say is tricksy because it capitializes on the not-so-obvious observeration
that testing the three numbers closest together is your best <cough-certain> chance of identifying
a 'triangle'.  Thus providing for a sort (O(log(N) and a single pass O(N)) => O(N * log(N))
eg:
input: [10, 2, 5, 1, 8, 20]
sorted: [1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 20]
tests:
[1,2,5] = 3 > 5 = 0
[2,5,8] = 7 > 8 = 0
[5,8,10] = 13 > 10 = 1!
eg:
input: [10, 50, 5, 1]
sorted: [1, 5, 10, 50]
tests:
[1,5,10] = 6 > 10 = 0
[5,10,50] = 15 > 50 = 0

# Problem Description
A zero indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if 0 <= P < Q < R < N and:
        A[P] + A[Q] > A[R],
        A[Q] + A[R] > A[P],
        A[R] + A[P] > A[Q].
For example, consider array A such that:
  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 20
Triplet (0, 2, 4) is triangular.
Write a function:
    def solution(A)
that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns 1 if there exists a triangular triplet for this array and returns 0 otherwise.
For example, given array A such that:
  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 20
the function should return 1, as explained above. Given array A such that:
  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 50    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1
the function should return 0.
Assume that:
        N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [-2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
Complexity:
        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.
